## Introduction

In early 2020, I served as the Lead Designer at Tribepad, a UK-based HR software company, working within the New Innovations team. My primary responsibility was to design and develop a new user experience for hiring managers, aimed at streamlining and optimising the candidate progression process.

## Key Features

- **Unified applicant processing:** consolidated critical hiring functions onto a single, intuitive page, enabling hiring managers to manage applicants seamlessly.
- **Simplified candidate overview:** redesigned the presentation of candidate profiles, application statuses, and interactions for clarity and ease of use.
- **Enhanced user experience:** streamlined the interface to reduce complexity and improve efficiency for hiring managers.
- **Communication workflow integration:** visualised key communication workflows and logic to guide hiring managers as candidates progress through the hiring process.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma** – Designed and managed UI/UX assets, including wireframes and interactive prototypes for the hiring manager dashboard and candidate progression workflows.
- **HTML & CSS** – Developed and styled front-end components to implement the responsive and user-friendly interface for the new hiring manager experience.
- **Whimsical** – Created low-fidelity wireframes and flowcharts to map out the candidate progression process and initial user journeys.
- **Miro** – Facilitated collaborative planning, brainstorming sessions, and workshops with cross-functional teams to align on project goals and refine the user experience.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was the lack of clear labelling for applicant stages, which hindered hiring managers' ability to track candidate progress. To address this, I conducted interviews with hiring managers to identify pain points and used the ‘How might we’ exercise to reframe feedback. This revealed three core areas for improvement: automating applicant communication, enhancing job opening notifications, and refining UX interactions.


## Outcome

The solution included simplifying stage labels and implementing a Kanban-style system with columns representing each hiring stage, providing a clear visual workflow. We found hiring managers wanted to manage the application workflow and make tweaks specific to their roles, so we incorporated customizable features to meet these needs. Integrated previews of candidate applications (e.g., CVs and social media) were added, enabling hiring managers to view role statuses and candidate details at a glance. This streamlined the hiring process and improved overall usability.
