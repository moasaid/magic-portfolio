## Introduction

As a contractor for the University of Sheffield, I designed a self-service solution that allowed students to quickly find answers to common questions. My work included designing page layouts, states, interactions, and final UI deliverables. While specific features and designs are the University's intellectual property, this case study focuses on the design process and facades to accurately represent the project.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive navigation and content groupings:** Organise information into clear categories to provide defined answers to common questions.
- **Responsive-first design:** Ensure the solution is easy to deploy and accessible across university devices, such as iPads.
- **Efficient search functionality:** Enable users to quickly and easily query information.
- **Actionable results:** Deliver answers that allow users to take immediate, meaningful action.
- **Accessibility:** Prioritise inclusive design with accessible language, layout, and UI for all users.

## Technologies Used


- **WordPress**: Utilised as the CRM and platform of choice to manage and structure content, enabling seamless collaboration with engineers to implement the design.
- **SketchApp**: Designed wireframes, UI components, and high-fidelity prototypes to visualise and refine the user flow.
- **Whimsical**: Created workflow diagrams and user journey maps to optimise the question-and-answer process.
- **Google Docs**: Documented design processes, user requirements, and team collaboration to ensure effective project management.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was adapting to students' shifting communication preferences. Research showed students preferred concise, actionable information over lengthy or open-ended questions. To address this, we introduced a Q&A format, which improved SEO and enhanced the search experience, especially through SSiD team interactions. We also added features like page legends and bookmarks to streamline navigation and better meet students' needs.


## Outcome

The project was a success, reducing enquiries to the student service desk by 26%. The student services team adopted the wizard, adding new topics post-launch. We identified areas for improvement, such as adopting more user-friendly UX for demographics like Mandarin-speaking international students. While the wizard excelled at addressing general topics, it highlighted challenges in handling more personal queries. This project redefined how student services could support students through digital solutions.
