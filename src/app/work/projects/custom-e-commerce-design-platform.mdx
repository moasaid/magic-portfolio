## Introduction

Designed a Shopify e-commerce platform that empowers hobbyists to create and seamlessly purchase custom laser-cut products.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was ensuring the website functioned seamlessly for its diverse users—shoppers looking for quick purchases, crafters needing customisation tools and community members booking workshops.

To achieve this, I optimised the user experience to deliver the shortest path to value. A key focus was enhancing the e-commerce checkout process while accommodating seasonal demand. Customization was particularly important for crafters, requiring an intuitive yet powerful design tool. Additionally, the Aalfy workshop system needed seamless integration, allowing users to easily browse, book and manage sessions alongside product purchases.

## Key Features

- **Seamless user experience:** Designed an intuitive Shopify storefront that simplifies navigation, making it easy for customers to browse, customise and purchase products.
- **Easy-to-Use customisation designer:** Developed a user-friendly interface that lets customers personalise laser-cut products with ease.
- **Integrated workshop booking:** Added a built-in booking system, allowing users to schedule workshops directly through the platform.
- **Consistent brand and product design:** Created a cohesive visual and UX design that reflects Aalfy's social enterprise values and community-driven mission.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma** – Designed and managed UI/UX assets, wireframes and interactive prototypes.
- **Angle 3D Configurator** – Enabled seamless 3D product customisation for a more interactive shopping experience.
- **Shopify Easy Appointment Booking App** – Integrated a user-friendly booking system for scheduling workshops.
- **Miro** – Used for planning, brainstorming and facilitating workshops.

## Outcome

This project offered valuable lessons in stakeholder management and aligning the business owner's vision with project goals. With a tight timeline, the project required rapid yet thorough iteration cycles to maintain quality while meeting deadlines. Ultimately, this experience reinforced the importance of balancing speed, precision and attention to detail for a successful outcome.
