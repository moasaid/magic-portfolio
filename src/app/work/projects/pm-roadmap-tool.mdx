## Introduction

The first product I led design for was Pendo Roadmaps, where I was responsible for designing it into the Pendo ecosystem. One key feature I helped design was the Now, Next, Later Roadmap—an approach aimed at driving strategic planning rather than our existing timeline templates. Pendo Roadmaps offered as a free resource, allowed users to plan releases, leverage feedback and streamline product development. Ultimately, Pendo Roadmaps became a powerful planning tool for Product Managers to create, share and track milestones efficiently.

The new roadmap template was the second most requested feature, as users wanted an alternative way to share their roadmaps publicly. Once launched, roadmaps delivered real business impact, contributing to $2.2 million in pipeline revenue.

Right after my session with the team, I started design explorations in close collaboration with research and product.

## Discovery

Users struggled to coordinate specific delivery times due to competing priorities. They needed strategic templates that provided clear visualisation and prioritisation of features and initiatives. Notably, 22% of accounts disabled the timeline header on their roadmap.

Recognising this need, we leveraged Pendo’s Validate Ideas feature to poll users in-app on their preferred roadmap template. The Now-Next-Later (NNL) roadmap emerged as the clear winner, securing 53% of the votes. Additionally, our design partners echoed this preference.

Based on user feedback, we determined that a Kanban-style would be the ideal solution. Since this layout closely resembled Kanban boards, much of the discovery phase focused on ensuring that roadmap items fit seamlessly into a column-based structure, delivering a cohesive and intuitive experience.

## What I delivered

#### **Connecting Feedback to Roadmaps**

The NNL roadmap was designed to be fully compatible with the Timeline roadmap, ensuring a seamless experience across Roadmap views.

One of the key achievements was enabling Voice of Customer (VOC) items, such as Ideas from Listen, to be directly added to the roadmap. This integration helped users close the communication loop within our product discovery platform, allowing teams to prioritise user insights and align roadmap decisions with real customer feedback.

#### **Enhanced Interactions**

We introduced intuitive interactions that users loved, such as drag-and-drop, reordering, inline editing and nesting. Building on this, we expanded functionality for Timeline roadmaps, enabling:

- Nested items for better timeline management
- Merging features to become initiatives groupings
- Moving entire columns or swimlanes in your roadmap

Each of these interactions underwent thorough exploration and iteration, ensuring consistency and usability across all roadmap templates.

#### **Customisation**

Users wanted more control over their roadmaps for internal sharing. Customisation was a key need, with many using their own column names to match their release process. To support this, I designed a way to rename swimlanes and columns, helping teams tailor roadmaps to their language and workflow.

## Next steps

- Unified design patterns to ensure a seamless experience across both templates.
- Introduced goal tracking & reporting for measuring items on roadmap delivery.
- Enabled public roadmaps with features like shareable URLs, email compatibility, and integration with the Pendo Resource Center.
- Further enbed roadmaps into the Listen product discovery, positioning them as a key communication tool for sharing product plans and closing the loop on user-submitted ideas.


## Learnings

After launch, I found that users mainly used roadmaps for planning and internal updates, not public sharing. Data showed they were hesitant to share externally, so we focused on making roadmaps better for team collaboration. The key learning here was that the intended use-cases can evolve from the start to the delivery of the project.

Designing a UI that felt native to Pendo while helping users plan was a challenge. It took constant iteration—dev sprints, design jams and testing. I learned that projects of this scale take time, patience and close collaboration to get right.
